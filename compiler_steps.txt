The steps we take for our incremental compiler approach.

* Parsing
* semantic checks
* transform toplevel defines 
* apply macros <ApplyMacros.hs>
* remove internal defines 
* declaration table

Right now everything is in <Parser/Transformations.hs>, but it will be changed
and if possible the transformations will become mere macros, and therfor will be
part of <Parser/ApplyMacros.hs>.
